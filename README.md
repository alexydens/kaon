# Kaon ($K^+$)
## NOTE: THIS IS THE OLD CODE. THE CURRENT VERSION BEING WORKED ON IS AT:
- https://github.com/alexydens/kernel
## Name
Kaons are strange particles. KN could can also stand for kernel (or knitting i
guess).
## What is kaon?
Eventually, kaon will be a working operating system kernel for x86_64 machines.
It is currently a work in progress, so it won't have some common features one
would expect from a fully-functional kernel.
## Dependencies
- [GRUB Bootloader](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/), or in theory any 
multiboot-compatible bootloader, although it will take some messing to get it
to work.
